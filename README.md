# RegisterAndUploadAndroid

*** I took the live demo website down so the Android app won't work unless you host the backend on your server and update the base URL in the Android's Java code as described in the "Get Started" section below

[Download the Android App](https://github.com/5haw4/RegisterAndUploadAndroid/raw/master/RegisterAndUpload.apk) â€¢ [Check Out the Web Project and Visit the Live Demo Website](https://github.com/5haw4/RegisterAndUploadWeb)

Fully working android example app, showcasing the functionality of the Rest Api of my [RegisterAndUploadWeb](https://github.com/5haw4/RegisterAndUploadWeb) fullstack project.
In the app you will be able to login / register and then create posts and browse through other users' posts, you can also upload an image with your post if you wish.

# Please note:
- All your posts and images are publicly visible to ALL app / website visitors.
